Modern web development using Aurelia

#Summary of your presentation, for the attendee
In the early days of my carrier as a Java developer most web applications where build using frameworks generating html (and JavaScript) on the server side.
However, times are changing and nowadays most of us Java developers are branching out to new territories when building web applications.
Angular, Ember, React or Polymer, they are quickly becoming part of the Java developer's toolbox.

In this presentation I will introduce you to *yet* another JavaScript framework for developing modern web applications; **Aurelia**.
Written in tomorrow's JavaScript it is one of the least obtrusive frameworks out there.
In a few slides and some code I hope to convince you why I think it is a worthy alternative.
